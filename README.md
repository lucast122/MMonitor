# Metagenome Monitor

This tool consists of two packages: Django Server (server), Desktop App (desktop). It is recommended to create two separate projects in your IDE for them. Refer to the individual README files for more details.


Make sure to use the same version of `plotly` and `dash` for the desktop app as is required for the server by `django-plotly-dash`.
