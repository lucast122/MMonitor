# KEGGCharter

A tool for representing genomic potential and transcriptomic expression into KEGG pathways.

## Features

KEGGCharter is a user-friendly implementation of KEGG API and Pathway functionalities. It allows for:

* Conversion of KEGG IDs to KEGG Orthologs (KO) and of KO to EC numbers
* Representation of the metabolic potential of the main taxa in KEGG metabolic maps (up to the top 10, each
  distinguished by its own colour)
* Representation of differential expression between samples in KEGG metabolic maps (the collective sum of each function
  will be represented)

## Installation

KEGGCharter can be easily installed with Bioconda.

```
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda keggcharter
```

## Running KEGGCharter

To run KEGGCharter, an input file must be supplied - see ```Testing KEGGCharter with an example``` section - and columns
with genomic and/or transcriptomic information, as well as one column with either KEGG IDs, KOs or EC numbers, must be
present in the file and specified through the command line.

```
python kegg_charter.py -f input_file.xlsx -o output_folder -mgc mg_column1,mg_column2 -mtc mt_column1,mt_column2 ...
```

## Testing KEGGCharter with an example

An example input file is available [here](https://github.com/iquasere/KEGGCharter/blob/master/MOSCA_Entry_Report.xlsx).
This is one output of [MOSCA](https://github.com/iquasere/MOSCA), which can be directly inputted to KEGGCharter to
obtain metabolic representations by running:

```
kegg_charter.py -f MOSCA_Entry_Report.xlsx -gcol mg -tcol mt_0.01a_normalized,mt_1a_normalized,mt_100a_normalized,mt_0.01b_normalized,mt_1b_normalized,mt_100b_normalized,mt_0.01c_normalized,mt_1c_normalized,mt_100c_normalized -keggc "Cross-reference (KEGG)" -o test_keggcharter -tc "Taxonomic lineage (GENUS)"
```

Just make sure ```MOSCA_Entry_Report.xlsx``` is in the present folder, or indicate the path to it. This command will
create representations for all 252 default maps of KEGGCharter. If you want to represent for less or more, run with
the ```--metabolic-maps```
parameter to indicate to KEGGCharter what maps to run (comma separated).

## First time KEGGCharter runs it will take a long time

KEGGCharter needs KGMLs and EC numbers to boxes relations, which it will automatically retrieve for every map inputted.
This might take some time, but you only need to run it once.

Default directory for storing these files is the folder containing the ```kegg_charter.py``` script, but it can be
customized with the ```--resources-directory``` parameter.

## Outputs

KEGGCharter produces a table from the inputed data with two new columns - KO (KEGG Charter) and EC number (KEGG Charter)
- containing the results of conversion of KEGG IDs to KOs and KOs to EC numbers, respectively. This file is saved
as ```KEGGCharter_results``` in the output directory. KEGGCharter then represents this information in KEGG metabolic
maps. If information is available as result of (meta)genomics analysis, KEGGCharter will localize the boxes whose
functions are present in the organisms' genomes, mapping their genomic potential. If (meta)transcriptomics data is
available, KEGGCharter will consider the sample as a whole, measuring gene expression and performing a multi-sample
comparison for each function in the metabolic maps.

* maps with genomic information are identified with the prefix "potential_" from genomic potential (figure 1).

* maps with transcriptomic information are identified with the prefix "differential_" from differential expression (
